# Ampang (APL) & Sri Petaling (SPL) lines

The CBD (Central Business District) section is defined as the section between Sentul Timur station and Chan Sow Lin station.

The non-CBD section is defined depending on which line you travel:
- Ampang Line: Chan Sow Lin station - Ampang Station
- Sri Petaling Line: Chan Sow Lin station - Putra Heights

As both lines share the CBD section, the train frequency is officially *always half the non-CBD frequency*. In other words, the train frequency is twice as fast in the CBD section.
