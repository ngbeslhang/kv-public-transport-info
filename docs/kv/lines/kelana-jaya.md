# Kelana Jaya LRT Line

## Duration

NOTE: Due to the the method in how I record the durations, as well as the variability in how long does it take for the stations to arrive, I've taken the liberty to round UP *all* recorded durations, which means the difference can be up to 1 minute from the actual arrival time. This means you should only use this chart as an estimate. However, I appreciate any feedbacks on making the chart more usable, including how to present the durations.

All recorded durations start/stop roughly when the doors-closing light indicators flashes, or when the doors-closing announcement starts playing.

TIPS: Use the browser's search function to find your origin and destination stations and calculate from there.
