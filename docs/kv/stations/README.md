# How to use

"Lines" section includes all line services available within a given station without needing to touch out of the gates (i.e. paid-to-paid integration).

"Connections" section includes all line services available within walking distance of the station that requires touching out of the gates instead.

Walking distance is defined as anything within 10 minute walk (~666m assuming 4km/h walking speed; 1km for 15 min assuming the same speed) radius of the station.
- For line transfer specifically, it will be from gate to gate (seating area for bus stations)
