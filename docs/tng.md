# Touch n' Go (aka TNG)

## Refund

While policy-wise you *can* [request a balance refund](https://customerservice.touchngo.com.my/erefund/) for your TNG card. Practically, you should NOT bother with requesting refund in any ways due to the following reasons:

- You can only request balance refund of specific cards AFTER you register your TNG card on their online portal, even if you are to refund *in person* in the head office at NU Sentral shopping mall (directly adjacent and connected directly to KL Sentral); you will be told to register online first if you want to refund in person without registering online first.
- Absolutely NO cash refunds, even if you request for refund in person. It must be by bank accounts only for both Malaysian citizens *and* non-Malaysian-citizen visitors/residents.
- For non-Malaysians-citizens, you can only request for balance refund IF your balance is more than RM100.
- The "refund requests will be processed within 30 days from the submission date" in their refund policy is **essentially a lie**. Some anecdotes:
    - I have been waiting for almost half a year since I returned an unused TNG card in person and requested refund into my local bank account (since I'm a Malaysian citizen), and it's *still* not processed to this day.
    - I know another Malaysian citizen who's been waiting for refund for more than a year or so.

If you are getting a TNG card, I recommend that you only top up the minimum required amount for your own use at all times.
